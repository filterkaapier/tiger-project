                  Before it burned to the ground, the structure </span> filled a small beach
                inlet below the Cliff House, also owned by Adolph Sutro at the time.
                Shortly after closing, a fire in 1966 destroyed the building
                while it was in the process of being demolished. All that remains
                of the site are concrete walls, blocked off stairs and
                passageways, and a tunnel with a deep crevice in the middle. The
                cause of the fire was arson. Shortly afterwards, the developer
                left San Francisco and claimed insurance money.

                During low tides, a powerful turbine water pump,
                built inside a cave at sea level, could be switched on from a control
                room and could fill the tanks at a rate of 6,000 US gallons a minute,
                recycling all the water in five hours.

          Discipline in typography is a prime virtue. Individuality
          must be secured by means that are rational. Distinction
          needs to be won by simplicity and restraint. It is equally
          true that these qualities need to be infused wiht a
          certain spirit and vitality, or they degenerate into
          dullness and mediocrity.
